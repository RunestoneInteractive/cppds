**Optional**: Graphics in C++
=============================

C++ is designed with the principal that speed is more important than safety and error-checking.
This differs from the majority of other programming languages, which tend to be considerably more
restrictive in regards to aspects such as memory allocations and resource management.
C++ is translated to "machine language" when it is compiled, which is a step skipped by other languages.

This difference is what allows C++ to be as fast as it is, which also makes it particularly good
for graphically-intensive applications. Graphical applications heavily leverage memory management
to display every pixel you see on your screen. Many languages do not allow for the creation of arrays like in
C++, which are just "chunks" of memory of a fixed size. Furthermore, running directly on the hardware
allows C++ to communicate better with other components of your computer, such as your graphics processing unit, or "GPU".
This is one of many reasons C++ is considered an industry standard for high-performance graphics applications, such as
video games or software used for visual effects in movies.

Turtle graphics are a popular and simple way for introducing programming to beginners. 
It was part of the original Logo programming language developed by 
Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon in 1967.

Imagine Turtles as being a digital marker used for drawing various shapes, images, and designs.
Drawing with Turtles can be as basic as a simple triangle and as complex as a highly detailed fractal image.
Nearly all commands used when drawing with Turtles are as simple as telling your Turtle to move forward, backward,
left, and right in as few or many steps as desired.

Introduction to Turtles
-----------------------

Visual representations afford students an opportunity to observe a facet of computer science
from an alternative point of view: rather than waiting anxiously for the print statement
to come around after your program churns, you get a visual representation of the concept itself.
This is particularly useful for abstract concepts such as recursion and iteration.

For C++, a library titled C-Turtle is used to provide an equivalent of Python's Turtles.
It acts as a close replacement to provide easy to use graphics to C++, while maintaining
the objects and commands present in Python. It was developed by Jesse Walker-Schadler
at Berea College during the summer of 2019 and can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/walkerje/C-Turtle/

Below is a comparison of two versions, C++ and Python, which should do
the same thing. Try running both and comparing how the code looks between the two versions.

Turtle & TurtleScreen
---------------------

Turtles must exist on a :code:`TurtleScreen` to be used. The :code:`TurtleScreen` object must
be created before you can create a :code:`Turtle` object for this reason.

.. code-block:: cpp

    ct::TurtleScreen screen;
    ct::Turtle turtle(screen);
    //Notice how the Screen is given to our Turtle when we create it.

Closing a :code:`TurtleScreen` when you're done with it is fairly simple to do. For this chapter,
only the method :code:`bye` is used. Calling it is not completely necessary, as it is also called
automatically if it, or an equivalent method, hasn't been called. When working outside of the
textbook, the :code:`exitonclick` method is also available.

.. code-block:: cpp

    screen.bye();

Turtles are based on the following premise: "There is a turtle on a canvas with a colored pen
attached to their tail." In this case, the *canvas* is a :code:`TurtleScreen`. This Turtle will
follow any command you give it, which consist of telling it to go certain directions, what color
of pen to use, when to raise or lower its pen, and others. Below is an outline of commonly used
methods when working with turtles.

=================  ==========================================================================
    Method Name                                  Description
=================  ==========================================================================
turtle.left        turns the turtle a certain number of units to the left.
turtle.right       turns the turtle a certain number of units to the right.
turtle.penup       raises the paint pen on the end of the turtle's tail.
turtle.pendown     lowers the paint pen on the end of the turtle's tail.
turtle.fillcolor   tells the turtle what color the inside of the shape will be. 
turtle.beginfill   tells the turtle to begin filling a shape as it moves.
turtle.endfill     tells the turtle to finish filling the shape it has created as it moved.
turtle.pencolor    tells the turtle what color it will draw with. 
turtle.width       tells the turtle how large of a paint pen to use.
turtle.speed       tells the turtle how fast it should go, faster or slower than the hare.
turtle.back        moves the turtle back a number of units.
turtle.forward     moves the turtle forward a number of units.
turtle.goto        tells the turtle to move to a specific coordinate.
turtle.write       tells the turtle to write some kind of text. 
=================  ==========================================================================

Many of these methods are used alongside one-another to create different images. All speeds are measured on a range of 1 to 10,
the latter being the fastest and the former being the slowest. The exception is the fastest speed, :code:`TS_FASTEST`,
which is set to 0. The :code:`TS` prefix represents "Turtle Speed".

============== ==========
 CTurtle Name    Speed
============== ==========
  TS_FASTEST       0
  TS_FAST          10
  TS_NORMAL        6
  TS_SLOW          3
  TS_SLOWEST       1
============== ========== 

Consider the following annotated example.

.. activecode:: cturtle_4
    :language: cpp
    :optional:

    #include <CTurtle.hpp>
    namespace ct = cturtle;

    int main() {
        //Create a turtle screen, and add our turtle to it.
        ct::TurtleScreen screen;
        ct::Turtle turtle(screen);
        
        //Set the turtle speed to the slowest available option.
        turtle.speed(ct::TS_SLOWEST);
        //Any number from 0 to 10 would work as well.
        //turtle.speed(7);
        
        //Sets the turtle's fill color to purple.
        turtle.fillcolor({"purple"});
        
        //Tells the turtle to begin filling a shape as it moves.
        turtle.begin_fill();
        
        //Tells the turtle to make a square.
        //Iterates once for every corner of the square.
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        
            //Tells the turtle to move forward 50 units.
            turtle.forward(50);
            
            //Tells the turtle to turn 90 degrees to the right.
            turtle.right(90);
        }
        
        //Tells the turtle to finish filling the shape it has outlined.
        turtle.end_fill();
        
        //Closes the turtle screen.
        screen.bye();
        return 0;
    }

The order of operations given to a turtle is important, as some actions must be completed
one after another. A good example of this is the :code:`begin_fill` and :code:`end_fill`
pattern, which must be called in that specified order to actually fill a shape.

Geometry, Shapes, and Stamps
----------------------------

Every basic shape in CTurtle is a set of coordinates. Within the CTurtle library we have the 
choice of a select few shapes that we can me our Turtles inhabit.
To change the appearance of your Turtle, you can use :code:`shape` to set your Turtle to 
one of four default shapes, or a custom shape. CTurtle features four default shapes, :code:`triangle`,
:code:`indented_triangle`, :code:`square`, and :code:`arrow`.

The following code example shows how to set the shape of a turtle by giving it the name of a shape.

.. code-block:: cpp

  turtle.shape("square");

Given that all primitive shapes are defined as a collection of points, all of the default shapes are also defined this way.
Polygons, for custom and default shapes, must have their points defined in counter-clockwise order to appear correctly.
This is due to the mathematics behind filling arbitrary shapes, and is a limitation almost all computer graphics need to
abide by. Consider the order of their points in the following table, and how they could be considered "counter-clockwise".
They are in order from top to bottom, and one edge exists between the first last points for each of these shapes. Please note
that positive Y coordinates are *lower* on the screen, while negative Y coordinates are *higher* on the screen. Coordinates at
the origin-- that is, coordinate 0x, 0y-- is at the "point" or "tip" of the turtle. This is why most of the default shapes
have their first coordinate there.

======== ===================== ========== ========
triangle   indented_triangle     square    arrow
======== ===================== ========== ========
(0, 0)          (0, 0)          (-5, -5)   (0, 0)
(-5, 5)        (-5, 10)          (-5, 5)  (-5, 5)      
(5, 5)          (0, 8)           (5, 5)   (-3, 5)
  .             (5, 10)          (5, 10)  (-3, 10)
  .               .                .       (3, 10)
  .               .                .       (3, 5)
  .               .                .       (5, 5)
======== ===================== ========== ========

Using the default :code:`indented_triangle` shape as an example, Figure 1 shows the nature of the counter-clockwise order.

.. figure:: ../_static/cc_polygon.png
    :align: center
    :alt: All points must be oriented, in order and in a leftwards direction, relative to the center of the entire shape.

    Figure 1: Indented Triangle Definition

The example code below illustrates how to create your own shape. We use the :code:`Polygon` class to represent our shape.
For this example, we take the :code:`triangle` default shape and make every Y coordinate negative to make it appear upside-down.

.. code-block:: cpp

    ct::Polygon upside_down_triangle = {
      {0, 0},   //First point
      {-5, -5}, //Second point
      {5, -5}  //and so on.
    };

The following code is a full example for setting your turtle to a custom shape. Feel free to mess around with
the coordinates of the polygon, you might surprise yourself with what shape you end up with!

.. activecode:: cturtle_geometry_ac_1
    :language: cpp
    :optional:
    
    #include <CTurtle.hpp>
    namespace ct = cturtle;

    int main(){
        ct::TurtleScreen screen;
        ct::Turtle turtle(screen);

        ct::Polygon upside_down_triangle = {
          {0, 0},   //First point
          {-5, -5}, //Second point
          {5, -5}  //and so on.
        };  

        turtle.shape(upside_down_triangle);
        turtle.forward(50);

        screen.bye();
        return 0;
    }

Stamps provide a way to make several copies of the shape of the turtle across the screen without having to trace each
shape individually with the turtle. This can be used for a variety of visual effects, however it is often used as a
time-saving utility. Stamps can be placed with the :code:`stamp` method of Turtle objects, which returns an integer
that acts as the **ID** of the stamp that has been placed. The :code:`clearstamp` method of the Turtle object can
be used to delete a single stamp from the screen, while the :code:`clearstamps` method is used to delete multiple
stamps at once.

The following code is a full example showing how to combine custom shapes with stamp placement.

.. activecode:: cturtle_geometry_ac_2
    :language: cpp
    :optional:

    #include <CTurtle.hpp>
    namespace ct = cturtle;

    int main(){
        ct::TurtleScreen screen;
        ct::Turtle turtle(screen);

        ct::Polygon upside_down_triangle = {
          {0, 0},   //First point
          {-5, -5}, //Second point
          {5, -5}  //and so on.
        };  

        turtle.shape(upside_down_triangle);
        
        //Draw a square where each edge is 50 units long.
        for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++){
            //Stamp at the corner of the square.
            int corner_stamp = turtle.stamp();

            turtle.forward(25);
            turtle.stamp(); //Stamp half-way across the edge of the square.
            turtle.forward(25);

            turtle.right(90);
            //Clear the corner stamp.
            turtle.clearstamp(corner_stamp);
        }

        turtle.clearstamps();

        screen.bye();
        return 0;
    }
    
Advanced Features
-----------------

Turtles are a large tool, and thus have a lot of options dictating how they function.
Some features and functionality are more complicated than others, relating to the inner workings
of turtles themselves. A few of these include the :code:`tracer` and :code:`undo` methods, and also screen modes.

Screen modes dictate the direction of angle measurements. This means that, depending on which mode a :code:`TurtleScreen`
object is in, positive angles could represent clockwise rotations or counterclockwise rotations. The :code:`mode` method
for :code:`TurtleScreen` allows you to set which mode a screen is in.

=========== ================ ================
    Mode    Default Rotation Positive Angles
=========== ================ ================
SM_STANDARD       East       Counterclockwise
  SM_LOGO         North         Clockwise
=========== ================ ================

Regarding angles, Turtles can use both *degrees* and *radians* for their rotations. You can choose between the two using the
:code:`radians` and :code:`degrees` methods for the Turtle object. By default, all angles are measured in *degrees*. This option
only effects methods regarding rotation, such as :code:`left` and :code:`right`.

.. code-block:: cpp

    turtle.degrees();
    turtle.right(90);//90-degree turn to the right
    turtle.radians();
    turtle.left(1.5708f);//Equivalent rotation in radians to the left.

The :code:`tracer(N)` method is used to control how many times the Turtle is actually
drawn on the screen. This method belongs to the :code:`TurtleScreen` object, and effects
all turtles that are on the screen. The :code:`N` in the method represents the input,
only allowing the :code:`TurtleScreen` to display one frame out every :code:`N`.

.. code-block:: cpp

    screen.tracer(12);
    //Show one out of every 12 frames of animation.

This can be combined with the :code:`speed` method available to turtles to achieve **very** quickly
drawn images. The maximum speed a Turtle can have, :code:`TS_FASTEST`, completely disables animation
for Turtles between movements and rotations. This allows the :code:`tracer` setting to directly relate
to the total number of actions the turtle makes. The actions the turtle takes happen regardless
of whether or not they are actually shown on the screen.

.. code-block:: cpp

    screen.tracer(3); //Show one out of every 3 frames of animation.
    turtle.speed(ct::TS_FASTEST);  //Disables Turtle animation

    turtle.forward(50);//This is not shown on-screen...
    turtle.right(90);//Neither is this...
    turtle.forward(50);//But this action is, because it is third out of three.

A frame of animation is added for almost every action a turtle takes, regardless of whether or not
the turtle is moving or adding something to the screen. This includes methods like
:code:`begin_fill` and :code:`end_fill`, which don't do anything visually but do
tell the turtle to start or stop tracking its own movements.

Consider the following example and related questions.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <CTurtle.hpp>
    namespace ct = cturtle;
    
    int main(){
        ct::TurtleScreen screen;
        ct::Turtle turtle(screen);

        turtle.speed(ct::TS_FASTEST);
        screen.tracer(6);

        for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
            turtle.right(60);
            turtle.forward(50);
        }   

        screen.bye();

        return 0;
    }

    How many frames of animation does the above code create?

Similarly to tracer settings, every action a turtle takes is also added to the *undo queue*. This allows it to keep track
of actions it is performing over a period of time. The queue is only allowed to grow to a certain size, starting at 100 actions total.
This is modifiable through the :code:`setundobuffer` method that belongs to turtles. Every action is added, even if
the action doesn't change anything visually. This feature is comparable to the "undo" tool available in most text editors.
Turtles can "undo" their progress with the :code:`undo` method.
