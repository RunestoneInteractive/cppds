-------------------------

Answer the following **Multiple Choice** questions to
assess what you have learned in this chapter.


.. mchoice:: cds_Sort_secondout

     I would like to move one paper from the two sorted sub-piles to the combined sorted pile. How many papers do I have to examine, at most, to identify the current smallest element of both sorted sub-piles?

    
    -   2 elements

        - Wrong! 

    -   4 elements

         + For you to identify the smallest of the two sorted sub-piles, you need to check the "top-most" and "bottom-most" elements of each pile so that would mean that you would examine 4 elements total.

    -   Size of the first pile

        - Wrong! 

    -   Size of the second pile

        - Wrong! 
    
.. mchoice:: cds_Sort_secondout

     How many steps does it take to fully merge two sorted sub-piles, A and B? (best/tight answer)

    
    -   O(log(A+B)) steps

        - Wrong! 

    -   O(A+B) steps

         + Correct! 

    -   O(A+B)^2 steps

        - Wrong! 

    -   O(A^2 + B^2) steps

        - Wrong! 
    
.. mchoice:: cds_Sort_secondout

     Consider an arbitrarily chosen (generic) particular exam and mentally track its progress throughout the algorithm. How many times does your exam pass through the merge step?

    
    -   1 time

        - Wrong! 

    -   2 times

         + Correct! 

    -   Θ(logn) times

        - Wrong! 

    -   Θ(n) times

        - Wrong!
