                            adjacent items, and swaps items that are out of order</p>

                            collection and inserts elements from the unsorted subset into the sorted

                        <p><idx>merge sort</idx>sorting method that uses recursion to split a collection in half until
                            there is one item and then combines the smaller subsets back into larger

                            the appropriate side of the collection, either less than or greater than
                            the pivot value</p>

                            the largest (ascending) or smallest (descending) unsorted element and
                            places it into its correct place by swapping places with the next largest
                            or lowest element</p>

                            individually using insertion sort, then also sorts the combination of the
                            sorted subsets using insertion sort</p>

                            using extra space) and places elements on the proper side of the split
